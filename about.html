                            ~ Open education has been called the biggest change in the way people learn since the printing press.
                            ~ Despite favourable studies on effectiveness, many people may still desire to choose traditional campus education for social and cultural reasons.
                            ~ Many open universities are working to have the ability to offer students standardized testing and traditional degrees and credentials.[83]
                            ~ The conventional merit-system degree is currently not as common in open education as it is in campus universities, although some open universities do already offer conventional degrees such as the Open University in the United Kingdom.
                            ~ Presently, many of the major open education sources offer their own form of certificate.

                            <li>It consists of evidence-based teaching and evidence-based learning. Evidence-based learning methods such as spaced repetition can increase rate of learning.</li>

                            <h4 style="color:rgb(138, 11, 138);">Learning Modalities</h4>
                            <p  style="color:rgb(7, 9, 139);">
                            Some theories propose that all individuals benefit from a variety of learning modalities.
                             while others suggest that individuals may have preferred learning styles, learning more easily through visual or kinesthetic experiences.
                              A consequence of the latter theory is that effective teaching should present a variety of teaching methods which cover all three learning modalities so that different students have equal opportunities to learn in a way that is effective for them.
                               Guy Claxton has questioned the extent that learning styles such as Visual, Auditory and Kinesthetic(VAK) are helpful, particularly as they can have a tendency to label children and therefore restrict learning.
                                Recent research has argued, "there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning styles assessments into general educational practice."
