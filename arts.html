                <b>Arts in education</b> is an expanding field of educational research and practice informed by investigations into learning through arts experiences. 
                In this context, the arts can include Performing arts education (dance, drama, music), literature and poetry, storytelling, Visual arts education in film, craft, design, digital arts, media and photography.
                 It is distinguished from art education by being not so much about teaching art, but focused on:
                 <ul style="color: rgb(29, 79, 3);">
            <li>how to improve learning through the arts</li>
             <li>how to transfer learning in and through the arts to other disciplines</li>
            <li>discovering and creating understanding of human behavior, thinking, potential, and learning especially through the close observation of works of art and various forms of involvement in arts experiences</li>
            </ul>
